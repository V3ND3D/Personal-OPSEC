# Personal OPSEC

> "Purpose over paranoia. Security without purpose is just noise." — Yeray

This is my personal OPSEC project, used as a professional portfolio piece and a living blueprint for privacy-conscious individuals. This document outlines practical steps and a guiding philosophy to reclaim digital and physical privacy in a world where companies and governments profit from your data.

## ⚡ Philosophy
Your digital privacy shouldn't make you miserable. If you're too paranoid, you stand out—and that in itself can be a vulnerability. Balance is key.

You can't fully escape surveillance, but you can limit the radius of exposure. This is about minimizing who you let in, and falsifying non-essential information when needed.

Your information is valuable, and data sells for high prices to advertisers, brokers, and sometimes even shady actors. Companies rarely care about lawsuits when the data trade is too profitable. Don't trust them blindly.

## 🔒 Digital OPSEC
### 💻 Devices
- **MacBook** used strictly for school and research.
- **iPhone** for daily use — VPN always on in public networks.
- **Gaming** limited to Xbox — no overlap with personal/work devices.

### 📬 Accounts & Data
- Migrated all key accounts to **ProtonMail**.
- No iCloud backups enabled.
- Strong, unique passwords.
- Deleted old online shopping accounts. All purchases are local now.
- Spotify, GitHub, and others run through ProtonMail.
- Personal identifiers removed from people search sites (verified).

### 🔑 Passwords & Managers
- Using Apple Keychain for now.
- Recovery plan will use second ProtonMail with zero identifying info.

### 📡 Metadata & Tracking
- Airdrop always disabled.
- Bluetooth & Wi-Fi turned off unless needed.
- Saved Wi-Fi reviewed and audited regularly.

### 🧹 Digital Footprint Cleanup
- Manually scrubbed personal data online.
- Name remains on GitHub for transparency.
- No presence in blockchain, smart devices, or digital wallets.

## 🧍 Real World OPSEC
- Prescription glasses with facial distortion and shaded lenses.
- No telemetry in current vehicle (2016 model).
- Address is private — uses PO boxes and delivery relays.
- Transactions made with PenFed card or cash.
- Lives off-grid in a wooded area with minimal exposure.
- Routine checks on people search databases.
- Phone number swap in progress to eliminate older breaches.

## 🧠 General Mindset
- Security should have **purpose**, not paranoia.
- Stay sharp, not fearful.
- Leverage security by obscurity when appropriate.
- Practice digital minimalism — only give what’s needed.

## ✅ This Is Ongoing
This project evolves with time. It's a personal tracker, public statement, and template for anyone reclaiming their privacy.
