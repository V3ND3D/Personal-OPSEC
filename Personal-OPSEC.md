# Personal OPSEC

> "Purpose over paranoia. Security without purpose is just noise." — Yeray

This is my personal OPSEC project, used as a professional portfolio piece and a living blueprint for privacy-conscious individuals. The goal is to reclaim digital and physical privacy in a world where companies and governments profit from your data.

## ✦ Philosophy

Your digital privacy shouldn't make you miserable. If you're too paranoid, you stand out—and that in itself can be a vulnerability. Balance is key.

You can't fully escape surveillance, but you can limit the radius of exposure. This is about minimizing who you let in and falsifying non-essential information when needed.

Your information is valuable, and data sells for high prices to advertisers, brokers, and sometimes even shady actors. Companies rarely care about lawsuits when the data is profitable.
